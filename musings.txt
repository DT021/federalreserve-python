A REST API to trigger an ETL process. (???) 
Doesn't seem like the best practice. For one, WSGI (flask) protocol is synchronous, that is the WSGI server can handle only one request at a time.
Two, each request, being an ETL process takes time. 

One way to solve this is to use a task queue like celery/redis and launch an ETL task.
But, this does not notify the client when the ETL task is completed (push notifications). The client can be notified that the task is submitted only.

So, websockets are an option for such push notifications?? Should we explore flask-socketIO or try using some kind of pub-sub mechanism to do things?

Worth exploring.
